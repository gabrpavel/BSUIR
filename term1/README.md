## lab 1 (C program structure, I/O functions)
### Tasks:
- Enter the radius of a circle. Find the length of the circle and the area of the circle bounded by the circle. Output the result to two decimal places.
- Three numbers a, b, c are given. Assign the value of the largest of them to the variable d.
- Determine which of the points in the plane A(x1,y1), B(x2,y2), C(x3,y3) is closer to the origin.
 
## lab 2 (Loop operators)
### Tasks:
- Write an algorithm to find a four-digit number starting with one and such that, if this digit is moved to the end of the number record, the number three times larger than the desired number will be obtained.
- Three friends witnessed a traffic violation. No one remembered the license plate number of the car - a four-digit number. From their testimony it follows that the number is divisible by 2, by 7 and by 11, only two digits are involved in writing the number, the sum of digits of the number is 30.  Make an algorithm and a program to determine the car number.
- Check if the number N is a Fibonacci number. If it is, print True, if it is not, print False.

## lab 3 (One-dimensional arrays)
### Tasks:
- In a one-dimensional array consisting of real elements, calculate the number of array elements greater than C.
- In an array of n elements, add 0 after each k-th element.
- Find the most frequently occurring number in an array of n elements. Do not use additional arrays

## lab 4 (Multidimensional arrays)
### Tasks:
- An integer rectangular matrix is given. Determine the number of columns containing at least one zero element; the number of the row containing the longest series of identical elements.
- Check if there is at least one row in the matrix containing an element equal to zero and find its number. Reduce all matrix elements by the value of the first element of the found row.
